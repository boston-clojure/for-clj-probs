;; Problem #110, Sequence of pronunciations
;; Difficulty: Medium
;; Description: <p>Write a function that returns a lazy sequence of
;; "pronunciations" of a sequence of numbers. A pronunciation of each
;; element in the sequence consists of the number of repeating
;; identical numbers and the number itself. For example, <code>[1
;; 1]</code> is pronounced as <code>[2 1]</code> ("two ones"), which
;; in turn is pronounced as <code>[1 2 1 1]</code> ("one two, one
;; one").</p><p>Your function should accept an initial sequence of
;; numbers, and return an infinite lazy sequence of pronunciations,
;; each element being a pronunciation of the previous element.</p>

;; User Solution:
(def __ )

;; Tests:
(= [[1 1] [2 1] [1 2 1 1]] (take 3 (__ [1])))
(= [3 1 2 4] (first (__ [1 1 1 4 4])))
(= [1 1 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 1] (nth (__ [1]) 6))
(= 338 (count (nth (__ [3 2]) 15)))
