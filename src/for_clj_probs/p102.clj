;; Problem #102, intoCamelCase
;; Difficulty: Medium
;; Description: When working with java, you often need to create an
;; object with <code>fieldsLikeThis</code>, but you'd rather work with
;; a hashmap that has <code>:keys-like-this</code> until it's time to
;; convert. Write a function which takes lower-case hyphen-separated
;; strings and converts them to camel-case strings.

;; User Solution:
(def __ )

;; Tests:
(= (__ "something") "something")
(= (__ "multi-word-key") "multiWordKey")
(= (__ "leaveMeAlone") "leaveMeAlone")
